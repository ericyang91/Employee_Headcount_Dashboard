# 📊 Interactive Power BI Dashboard – Headcount Analysis

This project showcases a dynamic and **interactive** Power BI dashboard that visualizes headcount data across multiple vendors, rooms, and regions in Korea. The dashboard was created to replace an outdated, table-based system that required manually opening separate dashboards for each month to observe trends.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

At work, a team was relying on an old, inefficient dashboard that displayed headcount data in a compact and static table format. It was difficult to navigate, hard to read, and required users to open a separate dashboard file for each month in order to view trends. It lacked both interactivity and visual clarity.

To improve this, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that:
- Consolidates all months into a single view
- Allows dynamic filtering by vendor, room, and month
- Displays trends and insights through clean, informative visuals
- Significantly enhances user experience and decision-making

- 📊 **Visuals**
  - **Line chart**: Full-time vs. Hybrid headcount trends over time  
    *(not affected by the Year/Month filter to show full context)*
  - **Donut chart**: Headcount breakdown by room  
    *(not affected by room filter for consistent comparison)*
  - **Bar chart**: Line of Business (LOB) headcount, filtered by vendor, room, and month
  - **Map of Korea**: Bubble size shows headcount per room by city location
